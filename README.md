- 👀 I’m interested in Linux
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to be master in my job as being a system/software engineer for a now globally aero company with a base in Dortmund/NRW, company was sold
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on hobby stuff like *buntu/Debian Linux and things around AVM fritz.box stuff
- 📫 How to reach me: email is enough
- I'm a proud owner of a TUXEDO laptop "Pulse 15 Gen2"
- My wife and my insulin-pump are only reasons for two devices with Microsoft Windows in my home :-(
- I was very young, as I first lay my hands on an APPLE 2e
- I do not like Apple since 1984. I keep that state of mind, you can't change my mind
- I once was an admin for Microsoft servers, but I was healed from that ... Go Linux!
- I worked for a german MNVE/MVNO, I used a lot of mobiles since 1995 ... I still don't like APPLE
- ⚡ Fun fact: i like numbers like 666 and 777
